# Data-Quality-Djagno

This is a website for each registered member to assess the quality of their data based on five metrics that we have designed from the literature.
The five indicators are the following:
- Completeness: Check data is not missing and sufficient
- Accuracy: Check the direction of coefficient and correlation
- Information Content: Calculate gain ratio and variance
- Security: Evaluated by questionnaire
- Timeliness: Evaluated by questionnaire
